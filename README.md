# SolantasyTracker
Tracking programm for the Solantasy NFT collection. Supports Magic Eden, Fractal and Solanart. 


# What does it do?
It shows all sales of a collection in a plot + all active listings on the secondary markets!

# How to use?
Download the chrome driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ (make sure to use the right version that fits your Chrome browser).
Download the programm itself. Make sure it's the newest release: https://github.com/Cedric-ai/SolantasyTracker/releases

Start the programm and select the chromedriver! Then click the collection you want to analyse. 
Then you have to wait. The analysis can take up to 20 minutes. There is a progress bar where you can check the progress.

When everything is done, an additional window will open where you can see all the data. You can zoom in and out, save the plot, etc.
If you press "m" the coordinates of the points will show. (press it again and the coordinates will go away)

# What if it doesn't work?
Changes in the secondary marketplace websites will lead to an error in the programm. I will try to fix these asap so you may try to download the programm again the next day.
If it still isn't working, try reporting the error here on the github repo.
